# Work on GitHub Issues

Use this skill when picking up work from GitHub issues in the repository that
contains the current checkout. It makes issues raised *against* that repository
discoverable, so each repository can independently pick up its own work.

## List Available Work

From anywhere inside the repository, run:

```sh
uv run .agents/skills/work-on-gh-issues/scripts/list_issues.py
```

The helper resolves the current checkout's `origin` remote, queries its open
GitHub issues, and prints a table with each issue's number, title, author,
opened date, labels, and URL. Issues carrying the
`renovate-dependency-dashboard` label are excluded because Renovate uses that
label for its bot-managed **Dependency Dashboard**, rather than actionable
project work.

To inspect one exact issue, pass its number either positionally or by option:

```sh
uv run .agents/skills/work-on-gh-issues/scripts/list_issues.py 42
uv run .agents/skills/work-on-gh-issues/scripts/list_issues.py --issue 42
```

Use `--state all` to include closed issues, and `--limit 100` when the default
list size is insufficient.

## Pickup Workflow

1. Run the helper before beginning issue-driven work.
2. If the user supplied an issue number, use that issue directly. If they did
   not supply one, triage the listed issues and recommend the most
   straightforward issue to pick up, with a brief reason based on its apparent
   scope, labels, assignee, and recent discussion. Do **not** autonomously
   select an issue, assign it, begin implementation, or otherwise treat it as
   picked up; wait for the user to choose an issue explicitly.
3. Once the user has explicitly chosen an issue, mark it as taken immediately
   by assigning it to the authenticated
   operator:

   ```sh
   gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee @me
   ```

   Do this before implementation. Do not remove or replace another assignee;
   if the issue is already assigned and that indicates active work, stop and
   coordinate instead of taking it over.
4. Read the full issue and its comments with `gh issue view <number>` before
   changing code.
5. Implement and verify the requested work in the current repository.
6. When communicating in another repository, use `collaborate-cross-repos`.
   Keep all GitHub identity conventions from that skill.

## Requirements and Boundaries

- The checkout must have an `origin` remote pointing to GitHub.
- The helper uses the user's existing `gh` authentication; it does not create,
  switch, or expose GitHub credentials.
- It lists issues for the current repository only. Change to the relevant
  checkout before using it to pick up work from another repository.
